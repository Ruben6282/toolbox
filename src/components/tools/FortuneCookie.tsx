              Fortune cookies are crisp cookies usually made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil with a piece of paper inside, a "fortune", on which is an aphorism, or a vague prophecy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers.

              Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States and other Western countries, but they are not found in China.
